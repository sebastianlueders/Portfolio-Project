          <p class="about" id="about-1">Back in 2015, I began researching blockchain extensively and tried my hand at day trading, inevitably resulting in my descent into the IT rabbit hole. Fast-forward to today and I&#8217ve co-founded a blockchain media company, worked with innovative entrepreneurs across various industries and developed digital marketing strategies and channels for various startups and small businesses.</p><br>

        <section>
          <p class="about" id="about-2">My main focus at this point in my career is developing my technical skillset so I spend most of my productive free time researching new technologies and hardening my network and coding expertise. I&#8217m currently wrapping up my Bachelors degree at Loyola of Chicago in hopes of entering the workforce as a security analyst or security architect.</p><br>

          <p class="about" id="about-3">When I&#8217m away from my desk, you can usually find me playing soccer, working out or hanging out with friends. I try to split my time equally between productive computer time and activities that challenge me physically.</p>
